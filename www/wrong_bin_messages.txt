Hazardous

Whoops! You put that in the hazardous waste bin!

Hazardous waste is garbage that poses a threat to either public
health or the environment. This includes items that are toxic,
flammable, corrosive, or have some other property which requires
that they are disposed of properly. This includes things like
paint, thermometers, pesticides and the blood of your enemies.

Recycling

Oops! You put that in the recycling bin!

Only waste that can potentially be changed into new products should
go into the recycling bin. This is done so that energy gone into 
making this waste can be salvaged instead of wasted (no pun intended).
Waste that should go in this bin include things like carboard, paper, 
and electronics.

Compost

Uh oh! You put that in the compost bin!

Organic matter should be the only thing going into a compost bin.
Compost is waste that can be decomposed and recycled as fertilizer
or soil amendment, and so only green waste should go into this bin.
That would include things like banana peels, leaves, and bread.

General

Oh no! You threw that into the general waste bin!

Something should only be thrown into the general waste bin if it
doesn't belong in any of the other bins. This means that it can't 
be organic or recycled, and it wouldn't hurt either the environment or 
public health if it were thrown into a landfill. This includes
things like styrofoam, balloons and plastic bags.
